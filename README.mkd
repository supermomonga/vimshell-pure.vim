# VimShell Pure

Pretty, minimal and fast VimShell prompt

Inspired by [Pure](https://github.com/sindresorhus/pure), the zsh prompt.



# Features

* Pretty designed prompt
* Display command execution time


# Installation

I reccomend to use NeoBundle.vim to manage Vim Plugins.
If you are using NeoBundle.vim, you only need to write following lines to your .vimrc and just execute :NeoBundleInstall.

    NeoBundle 'supermomonga/vimshell-pure', {'depends' : 'Shougo/vimshell'}
