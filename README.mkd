# vimshell-kawaii.vim

To use vimshell-kawaii.vim, you can change your VimShell's prompt dinamically by previous command's status code.


# Installation

I reccomend to use NeoBundle.vim to manage Vim Plugins.
If you are using NeoBundle.vim, you only need to write following lines to your .vimrc and just execute :NeoBundleInstall.

    NeoBundle 'supermomonga/vimshell-kawaii', {'depends' : 'Shougo/vimshell'}

# Usage

Run VimShell, and enjoy kawaii prompt.

    :VimShell
